Simplifying debts is an interesting problem that restructures debt within groups of people. It does not change the total amount that anyone owes, but it makes it easier to pay people back by minimizing the total number of payments

For example: say Anna, Bob, and Charlie share an apartment. Anna owes Bob $20, and Bob owes Charlie $20. Rather than making two separate payments, Splitwise would tell Anna to pay $20 to Charlie directly, minimizing the number of total payments. This ensures that people are paid back more quickly and efficiently.

I saw this feature on Splitwise and was curious about the algorithm working behind it so I tried to simulate it using Heap data structure.
